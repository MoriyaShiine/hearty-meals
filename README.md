  <h3>A small but impactful mod that removes the hunger system in favor of having food heal you directly.</h3>
</div>

The features this mod provides are:
* Removes the hunger bar and instead causes food to heal you, the amount healed being based on the original food value and the time it takes to heal being dependent on the original saturation modifier. You cannot eat food while you are currently healing.
* Adds a tooltip to all food items that shows you how much it heals over time.
* Adds an overlay to the health bar while holding a food item (or if you are in the process of healing) to show how much health you will gain.
* Repositions the armor bar to where the hunger bar used to be.
* Campfires give the Cozy effect when you are nearby, which slowly heals you over time.
* Fluid consumables such as Honey, Stews, Milk, and Potions are consumed twice as fast.
* Honey has a much greater saturation modifier.
* Potions can be stacked in Bundles.
* The Hunger status effect prevents you from healing using food, and damages you over time at higher levels.
* The Saturation status effect instantly heals you based on the amplifier.
* If Farmer's Delight is installed, the Nourishment status effect slowly heals you every 10 seconds.
* Optionally disables sprinting and enables instant regeneration and consumption, but these are all disabled by default.
